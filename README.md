# RoomApp

This app was specifically developed with the goal of implementing a Room database. It is important to note that Room is not a standalone database system, but rather a powerful abstraction layer built on top of SQLite. This additional layer simplifies the process of mapping database objects to Kotlin objects without the need for writing extensive boilerplate code.

In this app, the Room database functionality is utilized by incorporating Room DAO (Data Access Object) and entities. The Room DAO provides the necessary methods for accessing and manipulating data within the database, while the entities represent the objects that are persisted in the database.

By leveraging the power of Room, the app achieves a more streamlined and efficient approach to database management. The integration of Room's functionalities, such as simplified object mapping and optimized data access, enhances the overall performance and maintainability of the app's database implementation.
